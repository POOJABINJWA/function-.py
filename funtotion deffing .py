# Write a function named function_print_lines which takes 2 strings, 
# and prints them in the following manner.

# If we give these 2 arguments - "My name is Rishabh." and "I am the co-founder of NavGurukul"
# we will get the following output:


def list():
    print("My name is Rishabh.")
    print("I am the co-founder of NavGurukul")
list()
